                    From Tozeur to Tataouine via the vast sandy desert, the Tunisian South is a true world of its own whose diversity will amaze you. 
                    Explore mountains, the oases or the Berber villages, go hiking, bivouac under the stars… and even play golf.

                    <b>Chott Jerid</b> is one of the most famous sabkha in Tunisia and it's deemed to be the largest salt lake in Africa. Dominated by the Saharan Atlas mountain range, 
                    Chott Jerid is located in a very interesting geographical location between the algerian borders and the gulf of Gabes.
                    Extending for nearly a hundred kilometers from east to west, Chott el-Jérid continues at its eastern tip with Chott el-Fejaj.
                    Stretched along an east-west axis between Nefta to the west and El Hamma to the east, the entire area practically spans the width of southern Tunisia, 
                    between the Gulf of Gabès and the Algerian border, approximately twenty kilometers apart from the chott. Chott el-Gharsa in Tunisia
                     and then Chott Melrhir in Algeria complete this series of closed depressions with intense evaporation. The Jérid, the Fejaj, and the Gharsa are "vast sebkhas.
                      However, they will continue to be referred to by the name 'chott' established by common usage."
                    
                    Chott el-Jérid is located in a synclinal hollow, at the boundary between the Tunisian mountain ranges and the Saharan platform. Its current altitude is between 15 and 20 meters.

                    <b> Matmata (Arabic: مطماطة)</b> is a village in southern Tunisia within the governorate of Gabes.
                        
                    Even though New Matmata has become the main locality in the region, the center of the Matmata tribe remains the old village located 
                    in the heart of the mountains. Urban development and rural population migration have emptied and deserted the old village in favor of the new modern town.
                     Located southeast of Chott el-Jérid, in the foothills of Djebel Dahar, the Matmata Mountains dominate the vast plain of Djeffara and form a clear cuesta 
                     (515 meters) in the limestone and marl rocks of the Upper and Middle Cretaceous through various wadis.
                        
                    The village is forty kilometers southwest of Gabes. Perched on the mountainside at 600 meters above sea level, this village had 1,847 inhabitants in 2014.
                     It is renowned for its remarkable troglodyte dwellings, making it one of the highlights of Tunisian tourism

                    <b>Tozeur (Arabic: توزر)</b>is a Tunisian city located at the crossroads of the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara Desert, and it is the largest of the five oases in the Jérid region. 
                    Gradually developed around its palm grove, Tozeur is the capital of the governorate of the same name.

                    Situated in the northwest of Chott el-Jérid, near the Algerian border, Tozeur is 450 kilometers southwest of Tunis. With a significant religious history, the city has been a home to numerous scholars. 
                    Ibn Chabbat bequeathed to it the irrigation system for palm groves, and the poet Abou el 
                    Kacem Chebbi composed his famous "Ela Toghat Al Alaam" there during the French protectorate. Tozeur's contemporary topography pays homage to them, as well as to the marabouts.
                    The city has experienced significant demographic growth and considerable expansion during the second half of the 20th century with the sedentarization of Bedouins. 
                    In just a few decades, its population has increased from approximately 11,000 inhabitants to 37,365 inhabitants, according to the 2014 census.

                    <b>
                        Chenini (Arabic: شنني)</b> is a Berber-speaking troglodytic village in southern Tunisia located 18 kilometers from Tataouine.
                        
                        Saint Augustine believed that Kenini, whose name is said to have originated from Canaan, is the source of the word Chenini.
                        However, in the Berber dialect of Tataouine, the verb "chenna" means "to mix." It is dominated by a citadel ksar (fortified granary),
                        or kalâa, perched on a hill at an altitude of about 500 meters. This served as a storage place for food reserves and valuable goods and
                        also acted as a refuge in case of an attack. Like the ksours of Douiret or Guermessa, it "allowed the Berbers [...] to maintain themselves,
                        while establishing client and protection relationships with Arab tribes," especially during the Hilalian invasions in the 11th century.
                        "When the risk of invasion or pillage became less significant and with the sedentarization of the Berbers, the village began to develop on 
                        the slopes of the hill and downward," leading to the creation of the new village of Chenini around 1960.
                        Its white minaret once served as a landmark for caravaneers.
                        
                        A tourist destination on the circuit of ksours in Tunisia, Chenini is also the name of one of the moons of Luke Skywalker's planet in Star Wars, 
                        with many scenes filmed in the region. Renovated but traditional troglodyte dwellings serve as a tourist hotel.
