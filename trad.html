                <h3>tunisia traditional food</h3>
			    <p>
                    Tunisian cuisine, a typically Mediterranean cuisine, stems from an ancient tradition of gastronomic culture in Tunisia and reflects the successive cultural heritages (Berber, Punic, Arab, Jewish, Turkish, Greek, Italian, etc.).
                    It is influenced by the regional climate and geography of the country, and consequently, by its local products: wheat (found in the form of bread, pasta, or couscous), olives and olive oil, meat (especially lamb, beef, chicken, and other poultry,
                    and even camel in some southern regions), fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood (calamari, octopus, tuna, red mullet, sea bream, sea bass, etc.), especially along the coasts. This cuisine is notably distinct from its Maghreb neighbors: Tunisian tajine is different
                    from the Moroccan or Algerian versions, as are certain pasta dishes, salads, and more.
